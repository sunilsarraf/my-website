<h4>A civil engineer by profession and an artist by passion, Sunil Sarraf paints a world of simplicity, purity and innocence on the canvas.
    <br><br><br>
    A self-taught artist living in Indore, his growing years were spent in quaint villages of Madhya Pradesh. The rivers, the hillocks, the mud-homes, the simple village folks and their humble way of life have left an indelible impression on his heart and form the inspiration for his creations.<br><br><br>
    Sunil’s love for the earthy charm of the countryside is reflected in his choice of subjects. He is a painter of moments, painting unique moments from the village life - moments that tell a story, moments that convey an emotion, moments that hold a warm conversation with the heart. His keen sense of observation and spirit of exploration help him find such delicate gems which ultimately come alive on his canvas.<br><br><br>
    Sunil’s style of painting is realistic. His work has a real-life quality to it to the extent that many a times it becomes difficult to judge whether it is a painting or a photograph. The visual language is natural, vibrant, colorful and beautiful with minute attention to details.<br><br><br>
    Sunil has been a part of over 50 solo and group exhibitions all across India. His paintings have been selected twice for ‘Madhya Pradesh Rajya Rupankar Kala Puraskar Evam Pradarshani’ and exhibited at the renowned Khajuraho Dance Festival. His paintings have also been chosen twice for the prestigious Child Observatory-MP calendar. His work also features in the collections of art-connoisseurs of India and abroad.<br><br><br>
    Sunil’s paintings while amaze with their beauty, they also serve as a reminder of how our world ought to be - full of innocence, purity and simplicity!</h4>
